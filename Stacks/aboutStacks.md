# Stacks
## Introduction
A stack is a unique data structure used to keep track of the order of items. It is known as a LIFO, or "last in and first out". Have you ever wondered what happens when you press the "undo" button on a word document? The program removes the last thing you did to the document. What happens if you press the "undo" button again? It undos another one of the last things you did to the document. Notice that it doesn't make any changes to what you did when you very first started typing on the document.
Rather, it undos the latest or last change you made. This is an example of a stack and how it is commonly used. 


## Explanation
A stack contains a list of information where each new piece of information is put in the back of the line. We use the keyword "push" to add this piece. Next, we can only take away information from the back of the list using the keyword "pop". Be careful though! "Pop"ing off of the list deletes that piece of information forever. So if you are removing something from the list, you cannot get it back again.

To help you remember, think of a stack of books on the floor. You can't take the book from the bottom of the stack; that would make them tip over! Instead, you have to take the books from the top of the stack.
