# Data-Structures-Tutorial
## Welcome!
Let me introduce you to this program! This is a tutorial to teach and practice three common data structures: [stacks](Stacks/aboutStacks.md), [linked lists](Linked-lists/aboutLinkedLists.md), and [binary trees](Binary-trees/aboutBinaryTrees.md). The goal of this tutorial is to help you learn the basics of these data structures and how to use them. Each subject will incude the following elements:
* An introduction, which will explain when this structure is useful for programming
* A diagram (or two) to visually help you see what goes on behind the scenes
* A detailed explanation of the structure and how to use it
* A brief description and table of the structure's performance
* An example to see how you can implement the structure in your code
* A coding problem involving the structure to solve and practice what you've learned
* And, of course, a link to the problem's solution
